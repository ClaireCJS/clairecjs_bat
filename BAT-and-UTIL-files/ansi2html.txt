                              by Claire Jane Sawyer 1995ish

USAGE:  ans2html <infile >outfile

PURPOSE:  To convert ANSI color changes (but not animation) to an HTML-compatible color scheme.

SIDE-EFFECTS:  Also converts most high ASCII to an appropriate HTML equivalent.

POSTPROCESSING:  Search for "ERROR!".  If found, remove that tag.
                 Also, many times it changes to a color then immediately
                 changes to another.  These extraneous tags can also be
                 removed if you are so inclined.  I definitely could have
                 programmed this a LOT better.

COPYRIGHT:  Don't sell my program.  But feel free to fix up the code and mail
            it back to me.  I'll give you credit and put the new version up
            in its place.

COMMENTS:  I do not claim for the code to be elegant.  It produces HTML source
           that is over twice the size of the ANSI using many unneccesary tags.
           It also doesn't work 100% of the time.  But it at least gets most
           of the job done, and I needed to convert 800k of ANSI at the time
           I wrote this program.

COMPILER:  Turbo C 3.0, DOS (had 3 warnings when last compiled)

Converted to 64-bit EXE using MSDOS-Player in 2023.
