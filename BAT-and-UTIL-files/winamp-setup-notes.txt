***** TROUBLESHOOTING: *****

20170605:Solved: Winamp's mystery volume lowering was because MIDI files were in my playlist. 
    To Fix: 
        Midi plugin turn volume thing to off. 
        PLUS change device to DirectMusic/MS Synth (haven't tried without output)
            Winamp > Ctrl+P (for Preferences) > Plug-ins > Input > double click 'Nullsoft MIDI Player' > Device Tab > select from the Device: drop-down menu
    [To get keyboard to play better, make sure to change reset-between-song command to XG(Yamaha).]

202307 crashes:
	ForumBro says: Try removing gen_classicart and see if it still does it. Also make note of which file was playing or about to play next just before the crash. With gen_classicart removed see if you can view the album art of the files using the Alt+3 dialog.
202404 crash: 
	windbg DOES point to gen_classicart so removing that again! mine was gen_classicart.dll Album Art v0.7

* Album Art Viewer
	0.7 - isn't stable with winamp 5.9.2         
	1.1 (1.13?) - doesn't work with winamp 5.9.2
	1.03 - works with winamp 5.9.2! installed 20240321 - STILL NOT STABLE



***** TO BUILD A PERFECT WINAMP: *****

* install latest Winamp
	* playlist font size: 12
    * in advanced title formatting, change the hypen to an endash so that we can more easily parse out band name from track names that have a hyphen in them
	* other various options 

* LAST.FM: 
	* OLD: run last.fm -> detect players -> download scrobbler plugin -> install - but new version may not support winamp!
	* 2022: v2.1.33 (built on Qt 4.8.3) definitely scrobbled for winamp 5.666 - file should be in %INSTALLFILES%
	
* install WAWI web interface so that command-line control scripts (and other computers) can change music --user=clio --password=oh 
	* set up accounts: claire/oh
    * port should be 666 not 80
	* make sure claire is given "remove files" priviledge, or we won't be able to clear playlists from our command-line script
        [i like to give all privileges generally but this could be a security risk when using our URLs elsewhere, best to use a non-claire account outside-of-house]
    * music collection tab - 
            root=c:\mp3 [use symlink if that is not there]
            playists=c:\mp3\lists
            loadable filetypes=mp3 wav rm voc au mid stm mod vqf ogg mpc wma mp4 flac snd aac opus ac3
            check all boxes
    * logs tab - set log folder to  c:\logs\wawi\ - may have to create that folder
* Milkdrop
    * Install milkdrop
        * OLD: install Milkdrop1 (Milkdrop 1.04b.exe) to get MilkDrop1 support 
            * Quality: 2015: quality can now be maxed in every possible way, often close 60fps.
        * NEW: Milkdrop2 now comes with WinAmp
    * configure Milkdrop 2
        * EvilLyrics integration
            * figured out how to fake the directory path with junction once, but it requires forensics that I forgot how to do
        * Quality
            * 2015: Just max out every setting. We can handle anything now at 30fps, though only 10fps during some transitions.
            * 2007-2014: Radeon HD6870 - use:
                * use fake fullscreen
                * more settings: canvas stretch: none, mesh size: 96x72,  rest untouched
* set global hotkeys 
	* keep in mind Win-A gets used nowadays, as do a lot of the 'old school' ones we used pre-Windows 7 
	* best key for pausing the music is actually the pause key!  also the "special" 4 key on Logitech keyboards
	* Beware of the play/pause special keyboard key: Songs rewound to beginning when you don't want them to be will irk you. Pause is better than Pause/Play becuase it's a true toggle. Pause/Play is a guess.
* ReplayGain setup [now in Winamp=>Settings=>Playback and not in plugins]
    * Amplification mode: Apply Gain / Prevent Clipping
    * Preferred Source: Track
    * Adjustment for files without replay gain: was: -4.4db 2023: changed to -12db basically max down
    * ReplayGain preamp: +0.0db
* Other Plugins we use
    * Time Restore & AutoPlay v2.5.4 - to save place
    * Album Art v1.03
	* remote control plugins:
		* 2023: just using monkeymote
		* obsolete plugins:
			* remote control: #1: RemoteControl-For-Winamp (gen_RemoteControl.dll) - port 50000 - may need to manually create C:\Users\%_WINUSER\AppData\Roaming\WinAmp
			* remote control: #2: aWARemote Pro for Winamp - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.gebdev.aWARemotePro 
				* this is yet another remote control, a better one, being introduced into our house in  201604
			* remote control: #3: iAmpRemote v1.2: control Winamp via iPhone.zip (113,080)





NO LONGER DOING:
	* AUTOPLAY B.S. - There was a plugin that ensured you were playing when winamp started up.
			it MAY have been why winamp had trouble shutting down
			or it may have been my salvation
			will have to find out and will wait to see
		winamp seems to remember it's place nowadays, but NOT auto play on start...
		here it is: data-dvdr-288     - APPLICATIONS: AUDIO: PLAYERS: winamp plugin: AutoPlay by FastCode Software (20060324).zip (27,895)
		20120214 - tried  installing it - didn't seem to take effect, weird
        2015 - i found a better one
    * NO LONGER NECESSARY DUE TO NEW PRACTICE OF SPLITTING THE OPTICAL SIGNAL WITH A DEDICATED HARDWARE SPLITTER, AND THEN RUNNING IT TO A DEDICATED DIGITAL-TO-ANALOG CONVERTER. GOT SICK OF LATENCY ISSUES:
        * install Multiple Output Plugin to have analog out (for other rooms) in addition to digital out (for main room)
            * Direct Sound: 02: SPDIF Interface (TX0) (VIA High Definition Audio)
                * buffer length: 3891ms / prebuffer 0 / buffer-ahead 0 / enable cpu usage control
                * volume control: hybrid + smooth volume changes + logarithmic fades
                * allow acceleration
            * WaveOut: Headphone (VIA High Definition)
                * buffer length: 3891ms as of 2012 (but was 2000ms for 2011, so that may be right)
                    * actually, 3000 is good?!
                    ---

Okay.. I have read the rules for posting a good bug report and they are open in another window as I write this.  Assume everything they require (latest winamp, directx, etc) is true.  The details of my computer are in my signature but i'll gladly add more info at the moderators requests.


I have found a REPRODUCEABLE winamp bug.  Of course it would be nice if it was fixed.

In my experience, the very last stable version of winamp was 2.64.  I am trying to get a stable playing experience so that I can go to bed and wake up with music still paying (which is rare).

I've narrowed down a specific bug, through weeks of experimentation, and have determined its nature.

SUMMARY OF BUG:  If using a title that contains the filename (%7), certain long filenames crash winamp.

EXPLANATION:
If one goes into winamp settings->plugins->input->mpeg audio decoder->title->title formatting, one has the option of changing the default title formatting.  The default is "%1 - %2" which is "Artist - Title".  I don't like this so I changed it.  It has now come to my attention that %7 (mp3 title) crashes on certain long filenames.  This is a new bug possibly introduced around winamp 2.79.  

MY TESTING PROCEDURE:
1) I have found many mp3s that consistently crash winamp 2.79, but don't crash 2.64, and don't crash when renamed to "a.mp3" (short name).
2) I used one of these mp3s: FILENAME: f:\video\My Encodes\Dexter's Lab\AUDIO\Dexter's Lab - episode title ditty (Childish version) (from 'Dexter & Computress Get Mandark!' episode) (192kbps).mp3

Yes, that's a long filename. Windows supports 256 characters. I use them.

3) I went into the title formatting menu, and one at a time added each field until I determined that %7 is the crashing one:
FINE	%1 - %2
FINE	%1 - %2 - %3 
FINE	%1 - %2 - %3 %8
FINE	%1 - %2 - %3 %8 %c %4 %5
FINE	%1 - %2 - %3 %8 %9
CRASHES %1 - %2 - %3 %8\%7.%9 

It is definitely %7 that crashes.  

OBSERVATIONS:
The files that crash using this method seem to only crash when launched in single (mp3) mode.  Only in playlist (m3u) mode.  

MESSUPS I ENCOUNTERED WHILE TRYING TO FIGURE THIS OUT:
For awhile, I thought it was the id3v2 tag causing this.  I would shorten my id3v2 tag and shorten my filename and the mp3 would finally play.  I am only recently (tonite) realizing that the id3v2 title tag probably has nothing to do with this.

I HAVE INCLUDED A ZIP FILE CONTAINING AN EXAMPLE MP3 AND M3U.  FOR ME, CLICKING ON THE INCLUDED M3U MAKES A CRASH.

Some other filenames that crash in this situation (from my \new\mp3-new\crash directory I've been keeping for a few years):

Garfield - SPECIAL - Garfield In The Rough - 2_That's All I Need To Get By When I'm Out In The Rough (tape copy) (mono) (phased) (160kbps) UNTAGGED.mp3

Garfield - SPECIAL - Garfield In The Rough - 2_That's All I Need To Get By When I'm Out In The Rough (tape copy) (mono) (phased) (160kbps).mp3

Garfield In The Rough - 2_That's All I Need To Get By When I'm Out In The Rough (tape copy) (mono) (phased) (160kbps).mp3

=========================================
even with %7, i:\video\My Encodes\Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes-TAS\Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes-TAS - opening theme (alt ver sung by Chad & Tara from 'The Gang That Couldn't Squirt Straight') (192kbps).mp3 is crashing:
%c 				FINE
%c %4 %5			FINE
%1 %c %4 %5			FINE
%1 - %2				FINE
%1 - %2 - %3 			FINE
%1 - %2 - %3 %8			FINE

%1 - %2 - %3 %c %5		FINE
%1 - %2 - %3 %c %5 %8 		FINE -- same operators in differnet order crash!
%1 - %2 - %3 %c %5 (%8)		CRASHES - but same operators without parenthesis around %8 doesn't crash
%1 - %2 - %3 %c %5 %8\%7.%9	CRASHES - possibly because of %7
%1 - %2 - %3 %8 %c		FINE
%1 - %2 - %3 %8 %c %4		CRASHES
%1 - %2 - %3 %8 %c %4 %5	CRASHES	
%1 - %2 - %3 %8 %c %5		CRASHES
%1 - %2 - %3 %8\%7.%9 		UNTESTED
%1 - %2 - %8 %c %4		FINE
%2 - %3 %8 %c %4		FINE
%2 - %3 %8 %c %4 %5		FINE
%3 %8 %c %4 %5			FINE
%8 %c %4 %5			FINE

tride & true, heavy stability testing, makes best title:
%1 - %2 - %3     %c  %5






MILKDROP KEYS: F7 TO RE-LOAD MILK_MSG.INI






























"You should switch players"
"Why do you use winamp?"


A replacement program would have to:

1)  meet all the current functionalities i have (see below) before even being considered

2) provide new features  (i can't think of what I"m missing) 

3) new features would need to outweigh the migration effort, which would involve verifying every one of these functionalities, and reworking every side-script i use 

4) would have to stand the test of not failing under any of these conditions for a month+ 

WinAmp is still under development too, a new version even leaked in 2018.

-----------------

Here are my requirements:


- wide plugin ecosystem of 1000s of plugins for almost every obscure thing one can ever think of

- allow adding full m3u to existing playlist at command line

- not be ugly cause i'm used to things and white programs are evil and bright

- run under windows

- have a double-able window size (i have 4K, 1080p, and VGA screens)

- have plugins to play MIDI files - including sending them to my external keyboard

- have plugins to play STM, MOD, CMF, NSV old-school tracker files files

- configurable playlist font size

- ability to work with MiniLyrics and EvilLyrics

- Milkdrop integration including a milk2_msg.ini somewhere where i can symlink it to the location EvilLyrics overwrites the files with to send lyrics via hacking the milkdrop messaging system

- web interface that hopefully has similar URLs and ports for me to access via command line because I'd have to edit every one of those scripts 

- ability to read the state the player is in via perl script (like now, i have smart scripts that only pause it if it isn't already paused, etc)

- global hotkeys that work with the keys i like to use

- some kind of mini visualizer

- logarithmic volume control

- plugin to restore music to exact same location after song

- album art plugin

- iOS app for remote control - something as good or better than as MonkeyMote

- work with last.fm in such a way that the logfiles match what my perl scripts look for to identify the curer

- have a way to enqueue songs as the next track via command line

- support both directsound and waveout output

- support plugins to remove vocals, change pace

- have a 3rd party tray-control program (how Carolyn does it a lot from her computer)

- autosave playlists when changed

- have playlist change undo history

- have auto-complete for finding songs somewhere else in playlist

- support randomizing a playlist (fuck shuffle; sequential through a randomized playlist is the only true random)

- allow 24bit sound

- support ReplayGain tags in mp3s

- have configurable, scrollable, also-in-taskbar song titles

- be able to run from a folder without installation (i.e. "portable")

- there's probably some I can't remember right now.

-------------------

I'm open to suggestions, but they need to meet these requirements and provide significant additional benefits worth all the aforementioned effort.

-------------------

Now, for the "use Unix instead of Windows" crowd.   I already use most unix commands at my command-line.  A similar requirements list to my WinAmp list would probably have over 1000 requirements.

-------------------
