# Pre-rendered rainbow horizontal dividers

1000 files of pre-rendered rainbow horizontal dividers of different widths.

Whether your console display is 1 column wide (what are you, a vertically-oriented electronic billboard!?!?), 40 columns wide (what are you, an Apple 2?!?), 80 columns wide (what are you, a DOS machine?!?!), or 1000 columns wide (what are you, a movie theatre screen?!), or anything in between, a divider of your width is waiting for you.

If using the TCC command-line, you can generate a divider that is the proper width of your console with [divider.bat](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/display-horizontal-divider.bat)

## NOTE: You have to generate your own newline after the divider!  

If you don't like this, you could always append a newline to all 1,000 files. 
If you do, [lmk](mailto:cliocjs@gmail.com)! I'd like a copy just to be helpful!
