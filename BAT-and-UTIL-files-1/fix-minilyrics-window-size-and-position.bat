rem activate "minilyrics" pos=-1059,-1085,700,670 %+ rem this works but if it results in a not-high-enough, halfway-off-the-screen-to-the-left, maybe do this one instead:

rem 20241217: before getting new tv: 1080p+1080p main+4K upper-right+1080p monitor
    activate "minilyrics"        pos=-0708,-1085,800,800
    activate "Floating Lyrics"   pos=1208,-2157,1275,200

rem used to do this here: call fix-winamp %*
