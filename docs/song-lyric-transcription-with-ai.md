# AI Lyric Transcription System For Windows

## Goal:

*General goal*: To see the lyrics to music highlighted as they are sung

*Technical goal*: To automate AI transcription of music into karaoke files

*Specific technical goal*: To have the [MiniLyrics](https://minilyrics.en.softonic.com/) program correctly display lyrics as they are sung.

*Detailed goal*: To obtain and approve accurate lyrics for songs, which are then used as a prompt to improve the accuracy of WhisperAI's transcription of audio files into karaoke/subtitle files.

## Terminology:

*Karaoke Files*: We generally call both ```SRT files``` and ```LRC files``` "karaoke files", which is a colloquial shorthand for "files capable of displaying the lyrics *as* they are sung". This system generates SRT files, but includes a batch converter that converts SRT to LRC.

*Sidecar Files*: A file of the same name, but different extension. For example, "filename.txt" is a TXT sidecar file to "filename.mp3", which would be a lyric file. And "tilename.jpg" is a JPG sidecar to "filename.mp3", which would generally be cover art.

## Requirements:

1. The [latest Faster-Whisper-XXL binaries](https://github.com/Purfview/whisper-standalone-win/releases/tag/Faster-Whisper-XXL). 
    The command ``faster-whisper-xxl.exe`` — our AI transriber — must be in your path.

1. [JPSoft's TakeCommand (TCC) command-line v31+](https://jpsoft.com/all-downloads/all-downloads.html), which can also be installed with Winget via the command: ```winget install JPSoft.tcmd```.

1. My full [Clairevironment](https://github.com/ClaireCJS/clairecjs_bat/) (this project). It is built on top of my own personal environment layer and cannot exist outside of it.  ```git.exe clone https://github.com/ClaireCJS/clairecjs_bat/``` then move the BAT-file folder (#1, not #2) into ```c:\bat\``` .... Technically you probably only need about 30 of these files, but detangling things is a lot of effort.

1. Cygwin or other comparable version of ```sort.exe``` and ```uniq.exe``` and ```cat.exe``` utilities. (You might need to ```copy cat.exe fast_cat.exe``` if you don't have a fast_cat in your path.)

1. Optoinal: For automatic file-trash cleanup across an entire computer, you will need the ```Everything``` service to track files. It comes with TakeCommand (TCC). (Use ```start-everything.bat``` to start it, if it doesn't start automatically.)

1. Optional: For *WinAmp* integration: the [WinampNowPlayingToFile plugin](https://github.com/Aldaviva/WinampNowPlayingToFile), configured so that the 2ⁿᵈ line of its output file is the full filename of the currently playing song. This allows instant no-resource any-computer access to the location of which song file is currently playing in WinAmp, allowing us to have commands that operate on "whatever song we are currently listening to".

# SYSTEM COMMANDS

### 🌟 NOTE: Many commands have several different aliases, for convenience-of-remembering.

## Several types of commands for this system:

  1. Lyric alignment commands ([get-missing-lyrics](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/check-for-missing-lyrics.bat), [display-lyric-status.bat](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/display-lyric-status.bat), etc)
  1. Karaoke generation commands ([create-srt](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/create-srt-from-file.bat), [get-karaoke-for-playlist.bat](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/get-karaoke-for-playlist.bat), etc)
  1. Auditing commands (to find files that do not have lyrics or karaoke)
  1. WinAmp integration commands (to work with the song that is currently playing in WinAmp)
  1. Subordinate commands (under the hood stuff not generally invokved directly)

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

# Lyric Alignment commands:

These commands manage the lyric files that are used to improve prompt accuracy.

### 🌟 [get-lyrics-for-playlist.bat](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/get-lyrics-for-playlist.bat)

Gets lyrics for all the files *in a playlist* that do not have *approved* lyric files, in random order to avoid alphabetical bias.  
(Uses [check-for-missing-lyrics.bat](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/check-for-missing-lyrics.bat).)

### 🌟 [gml](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/get-missing-lyrics-here.bat) / [gmlh](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/get-missing-lyrics-here.bat) / [get-missing-lyrics](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/get-missing-lyrics-here.bat) / [get-missing-lyrics-here](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/get-missing-lyrics-here.bat)

Gets lyrics for all the files *in the current folder* that do not have *approved* lyric files.
(Uses [check-for-missing-lyrics.bat](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/check-for-missing-lyrics.bat).)


### 🌟 [get-lyrics {songfile} / get-lyrics-for-song {songfile} / get-lyrics-via-multiple-sources {songfile}](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/get-lyrics-via-multiple-sources.bat)

Obtains the lyrics for a particular song, to foster proper AI transcription. These transcriptions work much better when you have a lyric set. This checks local sidecar files, local lyric repository, Genius, and Google, to obtain lyric files with as much ease possible.


### 🌟 dls / [display-lyric-status.bat](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/display-lyric-status.bat)

Displays the lyric status (approved, unapproved, or unset) for all lyric files in current folder. 
To have this happen automatically when changing into a folder, simply Alias the ```cd``` command into ```call ```[cd-alias.bat](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/cd-alias) — and then create a file called ```autorun.bat``` in the base folder of your music collection, containing the command ```@if exist *.txt (call display-lyric-status)```.



____________________________________________________________________________________________________________


# Karaoke Generation commands:

These commands creates the karaoke files that are the primary goal of this project!

### 🌟 create-srt {songfile} / [create-srt-from-file {songfile}](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/create-srt-from-file.bat)

Performs the AI transcription process for a single song file.
Run without parameters to see various options, including but not limited to  "ai" (skips lyrics process), "fast" (shortens prompt timer lengths), and "force" (generate it even thoughi t already exists).


### 🌟 cmk / cmkf / [create-missing-karaoke-files / create-the-missing-karaokes-here](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/create-the-missing-karaokes-here.bat)

Create karaoke files for all songs *in the current folder* that do not have them

### 🌟 TODO [get-karaoke-for-playlist.bat](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/get-karaoke-for-playlist.bat)

Create karaoke files for all songs *in a playlist* that do not have them — Traverses a playlist, running ```create-SRT``` on every file in the playlist. (In random order, to prevent alphabetical bias.)

### 🌟 TODO create-karaoke-automatically-from-approved-lyrics.bat {folder to recurse through]

Create karaoke files for all songs in a *folder tree* that do not have them, as long as their lyric file has been previously approved. This is intended so one can spend 100% of time aligning/approving lyrics (i.e. with ```get-lyrics-for-playlist.bat```), then go to bed and run this to generate everything that has pre-approved lyrics, saving the karaoke generation for another time (like when you are asleep). 

### 🌟 [create-SRT-without-lyrics-or-voice-detection-for-an-entire-folder-tree.bat](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/create-SRT-without-lyrics-or-voice-detection-for-an-entire-folder-tree.bat)

Rarely used, but: Creates karaoke files for all songs in a *folder tree* without using lyric files or voice detection (VAD). This is useful for folders of sound clips and small samples, where you just want to get a lot done without the extra overhead of lyrics and without the extra time delay of loading the VAD model.

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

# Auditing Commands:

These commands find &Y obtain missing karaoke & lyric files.

### 🌟 [review-subtitles / review-all-SRTs / review-SRTs.bat / review-LRCs.bat](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/review-subtitles.bat)

Reviews all karaoke files in current folder, using ```print-with-columns``` to eliminate most scrolling up.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b579cf2-ca93-4684-aec5-35df8c793143)


### 🌟 cfmk / [check-for-missing-karaoke](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/check-for-missing-karaoke.bat)

Displays a list of files in the *current folder* which are missing *karaoke* files

### 🌟 cfml / cmlf / [check-for-missing-lyrics](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/check-for-missing-lyrics.bat)

Displays a list of files in the *current folder* which are missing *approved lyric* files

### 🌟 Lyric Auditor: cpfml / cpmlf / [check-playlist-for-missing-lyrics](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/get-playlist-for-missing-lyrics.bat)

Displays a list of files in a *playlist* which are missing *approved lyric* files.


### 🌟 Karaoke Auditor: [CheckAFilelistForFilesMissingSidecarFilesOfTheProvidedExtension](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/check_a_filelist_for_files_missing_sidecar_files_of_the_provided_extensions.py)

Processes a playlist to create a new playlist consisting of only the songs missing karaoke files.

EXAMPLE:
```
check_a_filelist_for_files_missing_sidecar_files_of_the_provided_extensions.py PlayList.m3u *.srt;*.lrc ``CreateSRTFileWrite
```
^^^ This example goes through the file ```PlayList.m3u```, checks for all files that do not have karaoke files (i.e. no ```*.srt``` or ```*.lrc``` sidecar file), creates a ```PlayList-without lrc srt.m3u``` consisting of those files.  Bbecause the `````CreateSRTFileWrite``` option was used, it also generates a script to actually create the missing karaoke files.  The ``GetLyricsFileWrite``` option can instead be used to *ONLY* obataining lyrics, and save the karaoke generation for later.


____________________________________________________________________________________________________________


# WinAmp Integration Commands:

These commands allows us to operate on "the song we are currently listening to" rather than a specific file or playlist.

### 🌟 [get-lyrics-for-currently-playing-song ](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/get-lyrics-for-currently-playing-song.bat)

Runs ```get-lyrics``` on the song currently being played in WinAmp.


### 🌟 srtthis / [create-srt-file-for-currently-playing-song.bat](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/create-srt-file-for-currently-playing-song.bat)

Runs ```create-srt``` on the song currently being played in WinAmp.


### 🌟 Karaoke insertion fudger - [eccsrt2lrc2clip.bat](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/eccsrt2lrc2clip.bat)

In certain very rare situations, MiniLyrics does not auto-import the generated SRT file.  Because MiniLyrics primarily uses LRC instead of SRT, it can sometimes miss an SRT. When this happens, the SRT must be converted to LRC, copied to the clipboard, and pasted into the MiniLyrics lyric window manually. This script handles that by detecting the current song playing, converting it's SRT to LRC, copying it to the clipboard, and automatically opening MiniLyrics's lyric editor window. All the user has to do is paste and save.

# Under-The-Hood: Critical Utility commands

Other important commands deveoped for this project.

### 🌟 [approve-lyrics / approve-lyric-file {lyric_file}](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/approve-lyric-file.bat) / [disapprove-lyrics / disapprove-lyric-file {lyric_file}](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/disapprove-lyric-file.bat)

Marks lyric file with approval/disapproval so that we can pre-approve lyric files in advance of transcription process. Uses [Alternate Data Streams](https://superuser.com/questions/186627/anybody-have-a-legitimate-use-for-alternate-data-streams-in-ntfs) to store approval tags in a database-less, file-less way.

### 🌟 [print_with_columns.py](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/print_with_columns.py) / [newspaper.bat](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/newspaper.bat)

Displays text in column ("newspaper") format so that lyric/karaoke review does not involve constantly scrolling up.

### 🌟 [google.py](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/google.py)

Invokes a google search in primary browser, all while properly preserving quotes. Way harder to pull off than it sounds.

### 🌟 [insert-before-each-line.py](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/insert-before-each-line.py) / [insert-after-each-line.py](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/insert-after-each-line.py)

Inserts text before or after each line of STDIN. Used for script generation. 

### 🌟 [srt2lrc.py](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/srt2lrc.py)

A *batch* SRT-file to LRC-file converter. Used by [eccsrt2lrc2clip.bat](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/eccsrt2lrc2clip.bat)

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________

# Under-The-Hood: Adjunct Utility commands

### 🌟 [srt2txt.py](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/srt2txt.py)

A *single-file* SRT-file to TXT-file converter

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________


# Under-The-Hood: Pre/Post-Processor Utility Commands:

Pre/Postprocessors developed for this project.

### 🌟 [get-lyrics-with-lyricsgenius-json-processor.pl](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/get-lyrics-with-lyricsgenius-json-processor.pl)

Extracts lyrics from our freshly-downloaded-from-Genius.com JSON files, with minimal preprocessing.


### 🌟 [unique-lines.pl](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/unique-lines.pl)

A lyric postprocessor that removes tons of junk from downloaded lyrics, only shows unique lines (to help fit into WhisperAI's 224-token prompt limit), and smushes all the lyrics into a single line (for use as a command line option). Started as a version of ``uniq``` that doesn't require file sorting, and grew into full-fledged lyric preprocessor.


### 🌟 [remove-period-at-ends-of-lines.pl](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/remove-period-at-ends-of-lines.pl)

A subtitle postprocessor that removes periods from end of each line in a subtitle. Preserves periods for words like "Mr."
We add "invisible" periods to the end of each line of lyrics so that WhisperAI's ```--sentence``` option works better. We then remove these periods (making them "invisible") afterward, because they are ugly.  Also has a side effect of de-censoring some curse words, which can be suppressed with the ```--leave-censorship``` or ```-L``` option.

# Under-The-Hood: Existing commands also used by this system:

Various commands that are already a part of my "Clairevironment".

### 🌟 [askYN.bat](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/askYN.bat)

The Yes/No prompting system with prompt timeouts.


### 🌟 [print-message.bat](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/print-message.bat)

The messaging system (used by [warning.bat](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/warning.bat), [debug.bat](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/debug.bat), [error.bat](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/error.bat), [fatal_error.bat](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/fatalerror.bat), [success.bat](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/success.bat), [celebration.bat](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/celebration.bat), [important.bat](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/important.bat), [important_less.bat](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/important_less.bat), [advice](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/advice.bat), [unimportant](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/unimportant.bat), etc)


### 🌟 [copy-move-post.py](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/copy-move-post.py)

A cosmetic postprocessor which employes ANSI color-cycling to inbue a psychedelic effect onto text by cycling the colors of the primary text color through the visible spectrum. Originally written to postprocess the output to the ```move``` and ```copy``` commands, with a mode added explicitly for postprocessing Whisper's output into something waaaay more visually interesting.

Uses my [claire_console.py](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/clairecjs_utils/claire_console.py) library to achieve the color-cycling.


### 🌟 [divider.bat](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/display-horizontal-divider.bat)

[Pretty rainbow-ized horizontal dividers](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/dividers/) to separate out output into sections.


### 🌟 [delete-zero-byte-files.bat](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/delete-zero-byte-files.bat) {filemask} 

Deletes all 0-byte files matching a filemask. Removes 0-byte files to save us having to check EVERY file for non-zero-ness.


### 🌟 [add-ADS-tag-to-file.bat](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/add-ADS-tag-to-file.bat) / [remove-ADS-tag-from-file.bat](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/remove-ADS-tag-from-file.bat) / [display-ADS-tag-from-file.bat](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/display-ADS-tag-from-file.bat)

Commands for displaying tags, and for adding/removing tags to files using [Alternate Data Streams](https://superuser.com/questions/186627/anybody-have-a-legitimate-use-for-alternate-data-streams-in-ntfs). Used for lyric [dis]approval.


### 🌟 [run-piped-input-as-bat.bat](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/run-piped-input-as-bat.bat)

Receives piped input and runs it as if it were a BAT file. Dangerous stuff!


### 🌟 [validate-environment-variables {list of env-var names}](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/validate-environment-variable.bat)

Validates whether environment variables (and the files they point to!) exist.


### 🌟 [validate-in-path {list of commands}](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/validate-in-path.bat)

Validates whether commands (be they internal, alias, or not) are in the path


### 🌟 [validate-is-extension {filename} {list of extensions}](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/validate-is-extension.bat)

Validates whether a file has an acceptable file extension.  


### 🌟 [validate-is-function {list of functions}](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/validate-function.bat)

Validates whether a TCC user %@function is defined or not


### 🌟 [bigecho.bat](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/bigecho.bat)

Echos, but in VT100-double-heighttext.


### 🌟 [set-ansi.bat](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/set-ansi.bat)

Sets all the ansi codes we know to exist.


### 🌟 [set-emojis.bat](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/set-emojis.bat)

Sets all the emoji we care to set, using the [emoji.env](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/emoji.env) file to add new emoji.


### 🌟 [mp3index.bat](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/mp3index.bat)

Technically should be called "audio_file_index.bat". Prints to STDOUT a list of all songfiles (mp3, flac, wav, etc).


### 🌟 [cat_fast.exe](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/cat_fast.exe)

Version of ```cat.exe``` deemed to be the fastest. I have several versions of the unix ```cat``` command, but this is the one I use for speediness.


### 🌟 [change-single-quotes-to-double-apostrophes.py](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/change-single-quotes-to-double-apostrophes.py)

Quote conversion offloaded into python script to avoid command-line complications with quote symbols. 


### 🌟 [del-if-exists.bat](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/del-if-exists.bat)

Delete a file, but only if it exists.


### 🌟 [edit-currently-playing-attrib-helper.pl](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/edit-currently-playing-attrib-helper.pl)

Used by ```go-to-currently-playing-song-dir.bat``` to determine the folder of the current song playing. Processes the ```winamp_now_playing.txt``` file generated by the [WinampNowPlayingToFile plugin](https://github.com/Aldaviva/WinampNowPlayingToFile) to determine this information. (API calls would limit us to only using this on the same computer as WinAmp, which is a restriction we do not want).  This is a very ad-hoc organic spaghetti script that isn'at all nice-looking, but the 2024 update branches past the ugly legacy 2008, 2009, 2012, and 2013 updates, which were all designed to work with the [Last.FM](https://www.last.fm/user/ClioCJS) logfile.

### 🌟 [go-to-currently-playing-song-dir.bat](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/go-to-currently-playing-song-dir.bat)

For winamp integration, changes current folder to same folder that the song we are listening to is in.  (The change-folder script is actually generated by [edit-currently-playing-attrib.bat](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/edit-currently-playing-attrib.bat))

### 🌟 [randomize-file.pl](../BAT-and-UTIL-files-1/randomize-file.pl.bat)

Scrambles the lines of STDIN.  One could think of it as shuffling/randomizing a playlist/filelist.  Used to do things in random orders.
