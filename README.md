# ðŸ¤“ The Clairevironment â€” Claire's personal script collection ðŸ¤“

## BAT files created for [JPsoft's TCC/TCMD command-line](http://www.JPSoft.com)...

### ...arguably the most sophisticated 64-bit command-line in existence, in constant development for over 35 years... 
### ...And this is the result of me using it for over 35 years.

This is basically a full layer of scripts built on top of TCC's functionality for 35 years, to add all kinds of functionality and improvement. Rich color, ANSI stylization, audio effects where appropriate, validators to prevent script brittleness, workflow management, repository validation, backups, maintenance, all kinds of stuff that is hard for me to describe because I've been working on this environment for 35 years. There's at least 800 scripts in this repo, though a lot are oneliners that call others and it's really probably only 300 significant scripts.

This is really about integrating existing tools that already exist.



---------------------------------


###  This is a full stack of stuff built around a command line. To use everything I've put here, you have to install everything as I've instructed here. This is what I go through every new computer. 

### â€¼ Make sure to use the paths specified. A couple things need to be in alternate areas.


The abridged instructions are: Install TCC, run *clairevironment-install.bat*, add TCC to Windows Terminal, and you're done!

But here are the proper instructions:

1. Download TCC (Take Command command-line) from [http://www.jpsoft.com](http:///www.jpsoft.com) and install it to the NON-DEFAULT location of <em>c:\TCMD\</em>. DON'T run it just yet.

1. Grab [clairevironment-install.bat](https://github.com/ClaireCJS/clairecjs_bat/blob/main/BAT-and-UTIL-files/clairevironment-install.bat), and run (double-click) it.  Follow its instructions and pay attention.

1. Add TCC to Windows Terminal and Run it: 
    Open up *Windows Terminal*, hit Ctrl-, (yes, control-comma) to go into settings. Scroll to the bottom of the left pane and click *Add new profile*. You can duplicate the PowerShell profile or start a new one.  All you need to do is change the name to "TCC", the command line to ```c:\tcmd\tcc.exe```, the starting directory to ```c:\tcmd```, and *Run As Administrator* turned on.
    Now run it.

1. At your freshly-run TCC command-line, type ```option```, and switch to the *"Advanced"* tab.  In the upper-left is a section called *"Special Characters"*.  Change the separator to "^" (the [caret character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caret)). 
    This is actually a deviation from how most people do things, due to the isolation of learning this command-line in the 1980s and 1990s. It creates complications that I've mostly mitigatedâ€”but not completely. Any mitigations I missed will cause failures unless you do this.


## At this point, everything is installed! The only problems you have at this point should be mostly-false error messages related to configuration.

1. To deal with mostly-false error messages, you will even5tually need to edit ```c:\bat\environm.btm```.<br>
	This is the most script, which is run every time TCC is run. This is the the equivalent of a unix .init/.rc type files.<BR>
	This script defines E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G. Harddrive letters (to eradicate the process of hard-coded paths in scripts), drive-to-machine mappings (for sharing drives across all local computers in this environment), repository locations (for validating and backing up all your various collections), the works. (Passwords, secret things, and secret API keys go in ```private.env```)
    * You ultimately want it to produce *no* output when it runs, or else there will be permanent ugliness.
      So let's get on that ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

## Now let's go over some things you definitely will want to do:

1. Define all your harddrives:
    * Edit ```environm.btm```and search for ```DEFINE HARDDRIVES``` and look through the next couple of pages. It looks absolutely bonkers, but redefinining the same information in a few different ways has been integral to ease-of-use. Just comment out anything that isn't YOUR harddrive. Unlike me, you might only have 1 computer and 1 drive, instead of 4 computers and 20 or so drives.
    * This will let you hard-code harddrives in scripts as environment variables instead of letters, so that if it is a different letter on a different computer in your house/LAN, there is a way to reference both locations correctly and simultaneously 
    * This will let you use our drive-related scripts, including: do-command-on-all-all-drives, wake-all-drives, map-drives, unmap-drives, checkmappings, display-drive-mapping, ensure-drive-is-mapped, label-all-drives, make-directory-matching-drive-label, wake-all-drives, myDrives, drives, whichdrive, c-drives


## Now let's go over some things you probably will want to do:

1. Define the computers in your system:
    * Edit ```environm.btm``` 
    * Search for ```set ALL_COMPUTERS_UP```, and list out the names of all your computers in your house/lan here
    * Search for ```set ALL_COMPUTERS```   , and list out the names of all your computers in your house/lan here, INCLUDING DEAD/BROKEN ONES.
    * Search for ```MACHINE-SPECIFIC EMOJI``` and choose an emoji for your computer (type ```env emoji``` or edit ```emoji.env``` to see a list of them, and use ```emoji-grep``` to search for emoji via regular expression)
    * Search for ```MACHINE-SPECIFIC COLORS``` and choose a color unique for your computer. 
    * This will allow you to use our computer-related scripts, including: all-computers, all-computers-except-self, colorize-by-computer-name, highlight-by-computer-name, display-drives-by-computer.  Various computers are associated with various colors and emoji, which allows a faster visual summary of what's going on.

1. Validate that your collections (repositories) haven't disappeared, and are fully accessible:
    * Edit ```c:\bat\environm.btm``` and search for "```DEFINE REPOSITORIES```".  For me, it's literally 35 screens of information about various repositories and workflows. Ignore or comment out what doesn't apply to you. Change what does apply to you. If you add anything, make sure to also add a validation for it. Follow the existing patterns in the file.
    * Run  ```c:\bat\environm.btm validate``` to validate all repository locations across all harddrives across all machines sharing this environment in the current house/LAN.  At first, it will be errors galore, because you are not me, and do not have my collections.  But after you edit *environm.btm* to properly reflect the locations of your collections/repositories (just follow the examples therein), you'll be able to use the *backup-repositories.bat* and *backups.bat* scripts, as well as validate that they are all still there. For me, with 20+ harddrives, this is often how I find out about a crashed drive.

1. Create a reliable backup plan for your collections/repositories:
    * Edit ```backup-repositories.bat``` to match the repositories you want backed up. IT'S REALLY EASY. If ```environm validate``` produces no errors, you likely can edit this without any knowledge and experience, and then run ```backup-repositories.bat``` to start running your backups. They may error out the first time, if the destination folder doesn't exist. But once you fix that, it should be smooth backup sailing for life.

1. Create a reliable backup plan for important individual files:
    * Edit ```backup-important-files.bat``` to reference important files you want backed up. Search for ```MAIN: BEGIN``` and follow the patterns within. For the dropbox functionality to work, you must have your dropbox-related variables defined properly in ```environm.btm```.

1. Create a reliable backup plan for important individual folders:
    * Edit ```backup-important-folders.bat``` to reference important folders you want backed up. Search for ```MAIN:``` and follow the patterns within. This one calls an individual BAT file for each important-individual-folder that you want to backup. Three examples already exist in the file for *Rogue Legacy 2*, *Xenia*, and *Rocksmith*. Follow the pattern to add more.

1. TODO

1. TODO

1. TODO

1. TODO


## And let's go over some things you MAY want to do:

1. Dynamically-generated PATHs accessible from PowerShell/CMD. Look at ```setpath.bat```. TODO.

## And here are some more esoteric things you can do:

1. Tagging music: Embedding album art and *ReplayGain* tags into music files

1. Controlling *Winamp*: Play/Pause/Stop/etc as well as randomizing/adding/removing songs to the playlist. Determining the current song playing (if winamp is integrated into last.fm).

1. TODO

## Cosmetic things you can do:

1. Change the message decorators and audio effects in ```print-message.bat```

1. Change the colors of your path (per-person, even) in ```setpath.bat```

1. TODO AUDIO

## Some best practices for scripting now exist:

1. Validating environment variables: ```call validate-environment-variable VARNAME``` to validate that an environment variable exists (and if it is a file/folder, it validates that the file/folder exists as well)

1. Validating commands: ```call validate-in-path whatever``` to validate if a command (internal, EXE, BAT, whatever) is valid

1. Validating successful runs: ```call errorlevel.bat``` will halt execution if any form of errorlevel is returned by internal or external commands.  (It uses visual and audio alarms that are defined in ```print-messages.bat```)

1. Automatically re-running tings that fail: ```errorlevel.bat``` sets an environment variable called ```REDO_BECAUSE_OF_ERRORLEVEL``` to 1, which can be used in conjunction with an if-then-goto statement to re-try something over and over. This is super-useful when a single peice of a long complicated workflow is brittle, and you find yourself having to interrupt workflow automation to fix things in the middle. This allows you to get that failed step working, then press any key to continue without losing your place.

1. Improving accessibility by adding emoji to your scripts. Thousands are defined as enironment variables in ```set-emojis.bat```, as well as custom pentacle & pentagram & trumpet emoji created by (ANSI escape codes)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code] after hand-drawing and converting to [sixels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sixel))

1. Improving accessibility by adding color to your scripts.  Environment variables defined in ``set-colors.bat``` allow color-changing via ANSI codes, including custom-RGB foreground/background colors, and random colors to help differentiate when wrapped lines end (each line is a different color).

1. Improving accessibility by adding formatting to your scripts: double-height text, bold & faint text, italicized & underscored text, blinking & reverse text, double-width text, and strikethrough text. Environment variables defined in ``set-colors.bat``` make it very easy. For example:
```
	echo %@RANDCOLOR_FG[]This randomly-colored text has %BOLD_ON%bold%BOLD_OFF% and %ITALICS_ON%italics%ITALICS_OFF% text, and %@ANSI_RGB_FG[0,155,0] I really like this shade of green, %@ANSI_RGB_FG[0,0,50] especially with a slightly blue background to it.
```

1. Improving presentation by adding ANSI cursor position manipulation. For example, a prompt can be blinking to draw attention to it, and once answered, re-drawn without the blinking, to help properly focus attention.  ```set-colors.bat``` defines various cursor functions like ```%ANSI_POSITION_SAVE%```, ```%ANSI_POSITION_RESTRE%```, ```%@ANSI_MOVE_UP[1]```, and such.  We also stick ```%ANSI_EOL%``` at the end of lines a lot in order to fix the bug where background colors bleed over to the rightmost column of the screen.

1. Eradicating the bad practice of hard-coded paths by having environment variables set to each drive.

## Some scripts that drastically increase scripting power now exist:

1. ```all-ready-drives.bat```can run a command on every single harddrive in your house/LAN

1. ```.bat``` 
1. ```.bat``` 
1. ```.bat``` 
1. ```.bat``` 
1. ```.bat``` 
1. ```.bat```

## Fun trinkets:

1. Never forget someone's age with ```age.bat```.  "How old is your mom?" ```age mom```.  "She's 77.389"



1. ENJOY THE CLARIEVIRONMENT!  There's soooooooo much stuff in here. In the future, I will add more reference to this page about them. For the most part, you just have to explore. Most stuff is fairly heavily documented/commented.<BGR>
   Remember: *c:\bat\setpath.bat* can be run to set your path, if you wind up in a situation where commands aren't in your path.<BR>
   Setpath.bat also generates a *setpath.cmd* so that if you go into PowerShell or other shells, you can use the same generated path.






















Here are the old, deprecated, manual instructions, in case *clairevironment-install* fails in the future:

1. Install the Winget toolâ€”which automated program installationâ€”by invoking the following command in PowerShell:
```
  Add-AppxPackage -Path "https://aka.ms/getwinget"
```
  Or the following command in CMD.exe:
```powershell -Command "Add-AppxPackage -Path \"https://aka.ms/getwinget\""```

  If this fails at some point in the future, try [searching for "Winget"](https://apps.microsoft.com/search?query=winget+&hl=en-us&gl=US) in the [Microsoft App Store](https://apps.microsoft.com), but be wary of malware repacked versionsâ€”â€”finding the official one this way can be challenging.

1. A lot of my stuff uses unix commands, so you should <em>probably</em> install cygwin from [here](https://www.cygwin.com/install.html), or with *"winget install --id=Cygwin.Cygwin -e"* or learn to recognize which things are breaking because of a lack of cygwin.

1. A lot of my stuff uses advanced ANSI codes that are ONLY supported in Windows Terminal.  The default Windows console can *NOT* handle these.  Install Windows Terminal either from the [official link at aka.ms](https://aka.ms/terminal) or [later/development versions from GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal)

1. Download my script/util folder into <em>c:\bat</em>, and place my *tcstart.bat* script into the correct folder<BR>
```
	git clone http://www.github.com/clairecjs/clairecjs_bat c:\clairecjs_bat.tmp
	move c:\clairecjs_bat.tmp\BAT-and-util-files c:\bat
	move c:\bat\tcstart.bat c:\tcmd
```

1. Add <em>C:\BAT\</em>to the BEGINNING your PATH:<BR>
```
   PATH=c:\bat\;%PATH% </em><BR>
```
   (A better way might be to go into advanced settings under Windows and edit it there.)<BR>
   (Impatient? Just run c:\bat\setpath.bat or c:\bat\setpath.cmd)

1. Configure *c:\tcmd\tcstart.bat*:    This is the minimal script that is run every time TCC is opened, transient or not.<BR>
   Open it up in a text editor and change the values for OS and MACHINENAME:<BR>
   <em>set OS=11</em><BR> â€” Valid values are: 95/98/XP/ME/2K/7/10/11 â€” for whichever version of windows you use
   <em>SET MACHINENAME=DEMONA</em> â€” Change this to your machinename! Or just use the same name as me ðŸ˜…<BR>

1. Run TCC.exe your first time, ignoring any errors.  But not directly!  You want to open it in Windows Terminal!   So open up Windows Terminal, hit Ctrl-, (yes, control-comma) to go into settings. Scroll to the bottom of the left pane and click <em>'Add new profile'</em>. You can duplicate the PowerShell profile or start a new one.  All you need to do is change the name to "TCC", the command line to "c:\tcmd\tcc.exe", the starting directory to "c:\tcmd", and run as administrator turned on.
   Now run it.
 
1. At your freshly-run TCC command-line, type ```option```, and switch to the "Advanced" tab.  In the upper-left is a section called *Special Characters*.  Change the separator to "^" (the caret character). This is actually a deviation from how most people do things, and it creates complications that I've mostly mitigated. However, if I missed any of those, this will be required for backward compatibility with bad decisions I made in the 1990s.

1. For EVERYTHING to work, we also need Perl. <BR>
   If you don't have Perl, install [Strawberry Perl](https://strawberryperl.com) to C:\PERL (not C:\STRAWBERRY), or else anything piping to Python or Perl will fail.<BR>
   Strawberry Perl can be installed with winget: *winget install -e --id StrawberryPerl.StrawberryPerl*
   You also may need my [my personal perl libraries](https://github.com/ClaireCJS/clairecjs_bat/blob/main/BAT-and-UTIL-files/perl-sitelib-Clio.zip) ... Sorry, they have no installer. Just download [the zip file](https://github.com/ClaireCJS/clairecjs_bat/blob/main/BAT-and-UTIL-files/perl-sitelib-Clio.zip) and unzip into into <em>c:\perl\perl\site\lib\Clio</em>

1. For EVERYTHING to work, we also need Python.<BR>
   If you don't have Python, install [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/download) or else anything using an adjunct Pythons script is likely to fail.<BR>
   Python can be installed with winget: *winget install --id=Anaconda.Anaconda3  -e*
   You might also need my [clairecjs_util Python package](https://github.com/clairecjs/clairecjs_utils) ... Sorry, it has no installer. Just <em>git clone http://www.github.com/clairecjs/clairecjs_utils</em> and copy that folder into <em>anaconda3\lib\site-packages\clairecjs_utils</em>


1. You will also want to pay attention to *c:\bat\environm.btm*.<br>
	This is the script that is run every time TCC is run in a non-transient way.<BR>
	This is the most important script, basically the equivalent of your unix .init/.rc type files.<BR>
	Open it up in a text editor.<br>
	You don't need to do anything at first â€” It's just important that you know this file defines EVERYTHING.<BR>
	E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G. 
	Harddrive letters, machine names, drive-to-machine mappings, repository locations, drive mapping information, IP addresses, the works. (Passwords go in private.env, however.)
	THIS IS THE MAIN FILE TO ORGANIZE MY COMMAND LINE LIFE.

1. Configure <em>c:\bat\environm.btm</em>:<BR>
	Run environm.btm over and over until any errors you don't like seeing are gone.<BR>
	You also could ignore them, but that would be ugly on your screen, and they tend to represent action items.<BR>
	*environm.btm* will now be the central script to handle all definitions of all things, to make sure your command line is in a PERFECT ZEN STATE for you.<BR>
	This file has an incredible set of messy examples that you can customize.<BR>
	Run *environm validate* to run the full set of repository location validation. This absolutely won't work but is a framework for making sure every repository you ever create exists in the correct place and is accessible from every computer in your LAN regardless of mapped drive letter differences.
	Ultimately, this is the file you want to customize for the rest of your life.<BR>
	If you have private environment variables you don't want in your <EM>environm.btm </EM>for privacy reasons, put them in <EM>c:\bat\private.env </EM>.


1. ENJOY THE CLARIEVIRONMENT!  There's soooooooo much stuff in here. In the future, I will add more reference to this page about them. For the most part, you just have to explore. Most stuff is fairly heavily documented/commented.<BGR>

---------------------------------


# I would absolutely love feedback! ðŸ¤“

I would love to know how this works out for somebody who has never done it. Nobody outside of my own family has ever tried to use my environment. Such feedback is something I could use to further generalize my scripts to be more workable for other people.
