# ðŸ¤“ Claire's personal script collection ðŸ¤“

## BAT files created for [JPsoft's TCC/TCMD command-line](http://www.JPSoft.com)...

### ...arguably the most sophisticated 64-bit command-line in existence, in constant development for over 35 years...

#### These BAT files have been in constant development for over 35 year too.

##### I've jokingly called this the "Clairevironment layer" â€”â€” A full layer of scripts built on top of TCC's functionality for 35 years.



### To install and use this, make sure to use the paths specified, because there is some ugly hard-coding at points. Do not deviate from these steps or things will eventually fail:

1. A lot of my stuff uses unix commands, so you should <em>probably</em> install [cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/install.html), or learn to recognize which things are breaking because of a lack of cygwin.

1. A lot of my stuff uses advanced ANSI codes that are ONLY supported in Windows Terminal.  The default Windows console can NOT handle these.

1. Download the TCC command line installer from JPsoft at [www.jpsoft.com](http:///www.jpsoft.com)

1. Install TCC to *c:\TCMD\* instead of to the default location in program files

1. Download these script files:
   <em>git clone http://www.github.com/clairecjs/clairecjs_bat</em>

1. Put these script files into the correct hardcoded location of *c:\bat*:<br>
   <em>copy clairecjs_bat\BAT-and-UTIL-files\ c:\bat</em>

1. Add *C:\BAT\* to your PATH:
   <em>PATH=%PATH%;c:\bat\</em>
   (A better way might be to go into advanced settings under Window and edit it there.)
   (An alternate method to do this quickly is to just run c:\bat\setpath.bat)

1. Copy *c:\bat\tcstart.bat* into *c:\tcmd*:
   <em>copy c:\bat\tcstart.bat c:\tcmd</em>

1. Configure *tcstart.bat*: Open it up in a text editor and change the values for OS and MACHINENAME:
   <em>set OS=10</em>
   <em>SET MACHINENAME=DEMONA</em> â€”â€” Change this to your machinename! Or just use the same name as me ðŸ˜…
   Valid OS values are 95/98/XP/ME/2K/7/10/11 â€”â€” I've used all of these over the years! Most people just want "11" these days!
   This is the minimal script that is run every time TCC is opened, transient or not.

1. You will also want to pay attention to *c:\bat\environm.btm*. Open it up in a text editor. You don't need to do anything at first â€”â€” What you will want to do is run "environm.btm" over and over until you are satisfied with what it does. This is the script that is run every time TCC is run in a non-transient way. This is the most imporant script, basically the equivalent of your unix .init/.rc type files. This defines EVERYTHING. File locations, executable extensions, every possible environment varaiabe, harddrives, drive mapping... Everything. It will likely trip up errors and need parts commented out. If you run "environm validate" it will most definitely fail, as this validates all (25+) of my repository file locations.  But this file has an incredible set of messy examples that you can customize. Ultimately, this is the file you want to customize for the rest of your life. If you have private environment variables you don't want in your environm.btm for privacy reasons, put them in a file called c:\bat\private.env and they will be read from that.

1. Run TCC.exe your first time, ignoring any errors.  But not directly!  You want to open it in Windows Terminal!   So open up Windows Terminal, hit Ctrl-, (yes, control-comma) to go into settings. Scroll to the bottom of the left pane and click <em>'Add new profile'</em>. You can duplicate the PowerShell profile or start a new one.  All you need to do is change the name to "TCC", the command line to "c:\tcmd\tcc.exe", the starting directory to "c:\tcmd", and run as administrator turned on.

1. Type <em>option</em> at the TCC command line, switch to the "Advanced" tab.  In the upper-left is a section called *Special Characters*.  Change the separator to "^" (the caret character). This is actually a deviation from how most people do things, and it creates complications that I've mitigated. However, it's required for backward compatibility with decisions I made in the 1990s (which I have not yet mitigated, and probably never will).

1. Now is the time where you might want to run *c:\bat\environm.btm* over and over until any errors you don't like seeing are gone. You also could ignore them, but that would put a lot of ugliness on your screen over and over.  As mentioned 3 steps ago, *environm.btm* will now be the central script to handle all definitions of all things, and making sure your command line is in a PERFECT STATE for you.

1. ENJOY THE CLARIEVIRONMENT!  There's soooooooo much stuff in here. In the future, I will add more reference to this page about them. For the most part, you just have to explore. Most stuff is fairly heavily documented/commented.
   Remember: *c:\bat\setpath.bat* can be run to set your path, if you wind up in a situation where commands aren't in your path. 
   Setpath.bat also generates a *setpath.cmd* so that if you go into PowerShell or other shells, you can use the same generated path.




# I would absolutely love feedback! ðŸ¤“

I would love to know how this works out for somebody who has never done it. Such feedback is something I could use to further generalize my scripts to be more workable for other people.
